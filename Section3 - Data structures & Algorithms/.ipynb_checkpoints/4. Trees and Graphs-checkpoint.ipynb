    "- [2 Minimal tree : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements,write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.\n",
    "     > *Hint :*          \n",
    "- [3 List of depths : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Given a binary tree,design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth(e.g.,if you have a tree with depth D,you will have D linked lists).\n",
    "     > *Hint :*          \n",
    "- [4 Check balanced : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Impleament a function to check if a binary tree is balanced.For the purpose of this question ,a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.\n",

    "- [5 Validate BST : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Impleament a function to check if a binary tree is binary search tree.\n",

    "- [6 Successor : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Write an algorithm to find the \"next\" node(i.e., in order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree.You may assume that each node has a link to it's parent.\n",

    "- [7 Build order : ](#) <br>  \n",
    "  You are given a list of projects and list of dependancies(which is a list of pairs of projects,Where the secondproject is dependent on the first project).All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is.Find a build order that will allow the projects to be build.If there is no valid build order,return an error.\n",
    "     > *Hint :*         \n",
    "- [8 First common ancestor : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure.\n",

    "- [9 BST sequences : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element.Given a binary search tree with distinct elements,print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.\n",

    "  T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees,with T1 much bigger than T2.Creat an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a  node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2.That is,if you cut off the tree at node n,the two trees would be identical.\n",

    "- [11 randome node : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which,in addition to insert,find,and delete,haas a method getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the ttree.All nodes should be equally likely to be choosen.Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode,and explain how you would implement the rest of the mehtods.\n",
    "     > *Hint :*          \n",
    "- [12 paths with sum : ](#) <br>\n",
    "  You are given a binary tree iin which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative).Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value.The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf,bbut it must go downwards(traveling only from parent node to child nodes).\n",
