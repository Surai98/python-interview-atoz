    " - [6 Towers of hanoi](#) <br>\n",
    "   In the problem of the towers of Hanoi,you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.THE puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top tp bottom(i.e.,each disk sits on top of an even larger one).You have the following constraints:\n",
    "   (1) Only one disk can move at a time.\n",
    "   (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.\n",
